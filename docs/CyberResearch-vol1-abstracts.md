<h3><a name="chapt1"></a>A Conceptual Framework for Archaeological Data Encoding</h3>
_Sveta Matskevich and Ilan Sharon_
<p>Field recording systems are the vocabulary and syntax of descriptions and low-level abstractions by which we characterize often fleeting and unrepeatable primary archaeological observations. Recording is the basis of all high-level constructs of archaeological theory. However, recording methods and archaeological theory have had an uneven relationship through the history of the discipline. In the world of postmodern archaeology, we have had to abandon the search for the Holy Grail—a single methodology that all archaeologists will accept as “best,” despite geographical, chronological, and increasing theoretical rifts. Yet in an increasingly networked world, there is a need for recording systems that, if they cannot mend these rifts, are at least able to communicate across them.
This paper presents a meta-model for field recording that conceptually suits all theoretical approaches and allows for the integration of data without losing its conceptual features. The case studies, drawn from the Tel Dor project (in Israel), show how the model integrates datasets from several excavation projects held on the site during the last hundred years, and how it handles complex post-processual archaeological concepts such as multivocality and uncertainty.</p>
