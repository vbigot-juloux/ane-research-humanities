<h4 style="font-size: 12px";><a name="chapt1"></a>A Conceptual Framework for Archaeological Data Encoding</h4>
_Sveta Matskevich and Ilan Sharon_
<p>Field recording systems are the vocabulary and syntax of descriptions and low-level abstractions by which we characterize often fleeting and unrepeatable primary archaeological observations. Recording is the basis of all high-level constructs of archaeological theory. However, recording methods and archaeological theory have had an uneven relationship through the history of the discipline. In the world of postmodern archaeology, we have had to abandon the search for the Holy Grail—a single methodology that all archaeologists will accept as “best,” despite geographical, chronological, and increasing theoretical rifts. Yet in an increasingly networked world, there is a need for recording systems that, if they cannot mend these rifts, are at least able to communicate across them.
This paper presents a meta-model for field recording that conceptually suits all theoretical approaches and allows for the integration of data without losing its conceptual features. The case studies, drawn from the Tel Dor project (in Israel), show how the model integrates datasets from several excavation projects held on the site during the last hundred years, and how it handles complex post-processual archaeological concepts such as multivocality and uncertainty.</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 12px";><a name="chapt2"></a>Landscape Archaeology and Artificial Intelligence: the Neural Hypersurface of the Mesopotamian Urban Revolution</h4>
_Marco Ramazzotti, Paolo Massimo Buscema & Giulia Massini_
<p>Today, there is a constant debate over computer semiotics as a discipline aiming to establish the function of the logical operators of programming on the basis of structured and complex semantic units. Semiotic analyses centered on redefining the analytical object are also one of the main trends in computer science and, in particular, in the sector interested in encoding physical systems into connective artificial networks of nodes or cells. Thus, the so-called artificial adaptive systems are synthetic representations of the observed reality that must undergo interrogation processes or the most advanced analytical tools for learning and modeling complex data-set configurations. Given these basic coordinates, it seems clear that simulating the dynamic and complex behavior of the high variability of the natural and cultural factors in networks thus conceived equals tracking down, selecting, and separately recreating a wide variety of functions associating variables, a wide variety of inferences controlling their semantic structure, and an equally wide variety of causes producing their transformation. In this specific sense, the application of artificial intelligence models to the Mesopotamian Urban Revolution Landscape has value: it recreates a possible world of other associations of meaning from the body of incomplete sources and scattered information, exhibits the nuances and complex interrelationships, and, furthermore, helps the researcher to codify other, unforeseen—or even hidden—interrelationships.</p>
