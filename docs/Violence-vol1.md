<p>Since always, violence is a characteristic of behavior shared by a large majority of the population, in many forms according to socio-cultural practices, whether violence is politic or not, within private or public sphere. Its forms of expression are either physical or psychological. Thus, violence testimonies are diverse: physical anthropology, written artefacts and images. The contributions in this volume explore a variety of topics related to ancient violence such as our modern discourse on ancient violence, the legitimation of violence, audiences for violent imagery, and structural violence. These essays challenge simplistic assumptions, inviting readers to look at the complex ways in which violence is deployed, described, and experienced.<br /><br />
This volume showcases papers mostly presented at the annual meetings of the American Schools of Oriental Research (<span class="small">asor</span>), at the European Symposium of <span class="small">asor</span> and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes–Paris Sciences et Lettres (<span class="small">ephe–psl</span>) held in 2018, and include a few additional essays too. The contributions to this volume which focus on a variety of sub-regions and time periods and engage with evidence drawn from archaeology, art history, and textual studies will be of interest to scholars of the <span class="small">ANE</span>--but not limited to them. The strong and current use of anthropological theories of violence in these contributions will make them appealing to scholars and students from other disciplines. In addition, we would like to market the proposed volume as a course resource for professors and teachers in ancient Near East, including Mediterranean worlds, and comparative studies to be used in the same manner as anthropological publications. As a resource to all readers, and especially to support the educational uses of this volume, we include a glossary of key terms, clearly defined for the non-specialist and university student. It represents an important step toward bringing scholarship considering violence in the ancient Mediterranean world and surrounding regions into step with theories of violence current in other related disciplines.<br /><br />
This volume is organized in four sections in order to sum up the main focus of each contribution: “Anthropology of violence,” “Strategies and violence,” “Legitimation of violence,” and “Representation and perception of violence.”
